# regexp/no-useless-quantifier

> disallow quantifiers that can be removed

- :exclamation: <badge text="This rule has not been released yet." vertical="middle" type="error"> ***This rule has not been released yet.*** </badge>
- :wrench: The `--fix` option on the [command line](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems) can automatically fix some of the problems reported by this rule.

## :book: Rule Details

This rule reports quantifiers that can trivially be removed without affecting the pattern.

This rule only fixes constant one quantifiers (e.g. `a{1}`). All other reported useless quantifiers hint at programmer oversight or fundamental problems with the pattern.

Examples:

- `a{1}`

  It's clear that the `{1}` quantifier can be removed.

- `(?:a+b*|c*)?`

  It might not very obvious that the `?` quantifier can be removed. Without this quantifier, that pattern can still match the empty string by choosing 0 many `c`s in the `c*` alternative.

- `(?:\b)+`

  The `+` quantifier can be removed because its quantified element doesn't consume characters.

<eslint-code-block fix>

```js
/* eslint regexp/no-useless-quantifier: "error" */

/* ✓ GOOD */
var foo = /a*/;
var foo = /(?:a|b?)??/;
var foo = /(?:\b|(?!a))*/;

/* ✗ BAD */
var foo = /a{1}/;
var foo = /(?:\b)+/;
var foo = /(?:a+b*|c*)?/;
```

</eslint-code-block>

## :wrench: Options
