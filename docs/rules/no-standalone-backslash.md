> disallow standalone backslashes (`\`)

## :book: Rule Details

This rule disallows backslash (`\`) without escape.

E.g. the regular expression `/\c/` without the unicode (`u`) flag is the same pattern as `/\\c/`.

In most cases, standalone backslashes are used by accident when a control escape sequence (`\cX`) or another escape sequence was intended. They are very confusing and should not be used intentionally.

This behavior is described in [Annex B] of the ECMAScript specification.

[Annex B]: https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-regular-expressions-patterns

<eslint-code-block>

```js
/* eslint regexp/no-standalone-backslash: "error" */

/* ✓ GOOD */
var foo = /\cX/;

/* ✗ BAD */
var foo = /\c/;
var foo = /\c-/;
var foo = /[\c]/;
```

</eslint-code-block>
