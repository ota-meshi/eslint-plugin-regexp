> disallow octal escape sequence

## :book: Rule Details

This rule reports octal escapes.

`\0` matches the `NUL` character. However, if `\0` is followed by another digit, it will become an octal escape sequence (e.g. `\07`).

Octal escapes can also easily be confused with backreferences. The same character sequence (e.g. `\3`) can either escape a character or be a backreference depending on the number of capturing groups in the pattern. E.g. the `\2` in `/(a)\2/` is a character but the `\2` in `/(a)(b)\2/` is a backreference. This can be a problem when refactoring regular expressions because an octal escape can become a backreference or vice versa.
