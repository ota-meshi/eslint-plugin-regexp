> disallow useless backreferences in regular expressions

## :book: Rule Details

This rule is a copy of the ESLint core [no-useless-backreference] rule.  
The [no-useless-backreference] rule was added in ESLint 7.x, but this plugin supports ESLint 6.x.
Copied to this plugin to allow the same [no-useless-backreference] rules to be used in ESLint 6.x.

## :wrench: Options

See [no-useless-backreference] document.
