> enforce using named capture groups

- :exclamation: <badge text="This rule has not been released yet." vertical="middle" type="error"> ***This rule has not been released yet.*** </badge>

## :book: Rule Details

This rule reports capturing groups without a name.

This rule is inspired by the [prefer-named-capture-group] rule. The positions of reports are improved over the core rule and arguments of `new RegExp()` are also checked.

<eslint-code-block>

```js
/* eslint regexp/prefer-named-capture-group: "error" */

/* ✓ GOOD */
var foo = /(?<foo>ba+r)/;
var foo = /\b(?:foo)+\b/;

/* ✗ BAD */
var foo = /\b(foo)+\b/;
```

</eslint-code-block>

## :wrench: Options

Nothing.
