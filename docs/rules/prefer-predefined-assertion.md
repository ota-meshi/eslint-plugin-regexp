# regexp/prefer-predefined-assertion

> prefer predefined assertion over equivalent lookarounds

- :gear: This rule is included in `"plugin:regexp/recommended"`.
- :wrench: The `--fix` option on the [command line](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems) can automatically fix some of the problems reported by this rule.

## :book: Rule Details

All predefined assertions (`\b`, `\B`, `^`, and `$`) can be expressed as lookaheads and lookbehinds. E.g. `/a$/` is the same as `/a(?![^])/`.

In most cases, it's better to use the predefined assertions because they are better known.

<eslint-code-block fix>

```js
/* eslint regexp/prefer-predefined-assertion: "error" */

/* ✓ GOOD */
var foo = /a(?=\W)/;

/* ✗ BAD */
var foo = /a(?![^])/;
var foo = /a(?!\w)/;
var foo = /a+(?!\w)(?:\s|bc+)+/;
```

</eslint-code-block>

## :wrench: Options

Nothing.
