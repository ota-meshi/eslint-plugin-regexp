> prefer predefined assertion over equivalent lookarounds

## :book: Rule Details

All predefined assertions (`\b`, `\B`, `^`, and `$`) can be expressed as lookaheads and lookbehinds. E.g. `/a$/` is the same as `/a(?![^])/`.

In most cases, it's better to use the predefined assertions because they are better known.

<eslint-code-block fix>

```js
/* eslint regexp/prefer-predefined-assertion: "error" */

/* âœ“ GOOD */
var foo = /a(?=\W)/;

/* âœ— BAD */
var foo = /a(?![^])/;
var foo = /a(?!\w)/;
var foo = /a+(?!\w)(?:\s|bc+)+/;
```

</eslint-code-block>
