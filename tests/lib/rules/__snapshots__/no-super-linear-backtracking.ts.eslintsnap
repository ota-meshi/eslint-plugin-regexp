Test: no-super-linear-backtracking >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /b(?:a+)+b/
    |      ^~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /ba+b/

[1] This quantifier can reach itself via the loop '(?:a+)+'. Using any string accepted by /a+/, this can be exploited to cause at least polynomial backtracking. This is going to cause exponential backtracking resulting in exponential worst-case runtime behavior.

Test: no-super-linear-backtracking >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /(?:ba+|a+b){2}/
    |      ^~~~~ [1]

Output: unchanged

[1] The quantifier 'a+' can exchange characters with 'a+'. Using any string accepted by /a+/, this can be exploited to cause at least polynomial backtracking. This might cause exponential backtracking.

Test: no-super-linear-backtracking >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /\ba+a+$/
    |    ^~~~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /\ba{2,}$/

[1] The quantifier 'a+' can exchange characters with 'a+'. Using any string accepted by /a+/, this can be exploited to cause at least polynomial backtracking. This might cause exponential backtracking.

Test: no-super-linear-backtracking >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /\b\w+a\w+$/
    |    ^~~~~~~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /\b\w[\dA-Z_b-z]*a\w+$/

[1] The quantifier '\w+' can exchange characters with '\w+'. Using any string accepted by /a+/, this can be exploited to cause at least polynomial backtracking. This might cause exponential backtracking.

Test: no-super-linear-backtracking >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /\b\w+a?b{4}\w+$/
    |    ^~~~~~~~~~~~ [1]

Output: unchanged

[1] The quantifier '\w+' can exchange characters with '\w+'. Using any string accepted by /b+/, this can be exploited to cause at least polynomial backtracking. This might cause exponential backtracking.

Test: no-super-linear-backtracking >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /[\q{a}]*b?[\q{a}]+$/v
    |  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /(?:[\q{a}]+(?:b[\q{a}]+)?|b[\q{a}]+)$/v

[1] The quantifier '[\q{a}]*' can exchange characters with '[\q{a}]+'. Using any string accepted by /a+/, this can be exploited to cause at least polynomial backtracking. This might cause exponential backtracking.
