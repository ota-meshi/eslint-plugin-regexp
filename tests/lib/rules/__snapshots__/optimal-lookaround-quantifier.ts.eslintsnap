Test: optimal-lookaround-quantifier >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /(?=ba*)/
    |      ^~ [1]

[1] The quantified expression 'a*' at the end of the expression tree should only be matched a constant number of times. The expression can be removed without affecting the lookaround.
    Suggestions:
      - Remove the expression.
        Output:
          1 | /(?=b)/

Test: optimal-lookaround-quantifier >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /(?=ba*)/v
    |      ^~ [1]

[1] The quantified expression 'a*' at the end of the expression tree should only be matched a constant number of times. The expression can be removed without affecting the lookaround.
    Suggestions:
      - Remove the expression.
        Output:

Test: optimal-lookaround-quantifier >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /(?=(?:a|b|abc*))/
    |              ^~ [1]

[1] The quantified expression 'c*' at the end of the expression tree should only be matched a constant number of times. The expression can be removed without affecting the lookaround.
    Suggestions:
      - Remove the expression.
        Output:

Test: optimal-lookaround-quantifier >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /(?=(?:a|b|abc+))/
    |              ^~ [1]

[1] The quantified expression 'c+' at the end of the expression tree should only be matched a constant number of times. The expression can be replaced with 'c' (no quantifier) without affecting the lookaround.
    Suggestions:
      - Replace the expression with 'c' (no quantifier).
        Output:
          1 | /(?=(?:a|b|abc))/

Test: optimal-lookaround-quantifier >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /(?=(?:a|b|abc{4,9}))/
    |              ^~~~~~ [1]

[1] The quantified expression 'c{4,9}' at the end of the expression tree should only be matched a constant number of times. The expression can be replaced with 'c{4}' without affecting the lookaround.
    Suggestions:
      - Replace the expression with 'c{4}'.
        Output:
          1 | /(?=(?:a|b|abc{4}))/

Test: optimal-lookaround-quantifier >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /(?<=[a-c]*)/
    |      ^~~~~~ [1]

[1] The quantified expression '[a-c]*' at the start of the expression tree should only be matched a constant number of times. The expression can be removed without affecting the lookaround.
    Suggestions:
      - Remove the expression.
        Output:
          1 | /(?<=)/

  1 | /(?<=(?:d|c)*ab)/
    |      ^~~~~~~~ [1]

[1] The quantified expression '(?:d|c)*' at the start of the expression tree should only be matched a constant number of times. The expression can be removed without affecting the lookaround.
    Suggestions:
      - Remove the expression.
        Output:
          1 | /(?<=ab)/
