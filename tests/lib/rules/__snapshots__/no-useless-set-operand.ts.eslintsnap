Test: no-useless-set-operand >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /[\w&&\d]/v
    |   ^~~~~~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /[\d]/v

[1] '\d' is a subset of '\w', so the result of the intersection is always going to be '\d'.
---


Test: no-useless-set-operand >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /[\w&&\s]/v
    |   ^~~~~~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /[]/v

[1] '\w' and '\s' are disjoint, so the result of the intersection is always going to be the empty set.
---


Test: no-useless-set-operand >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /[^\w&&\s]/v
    |    ^~~~~~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /[^]/v

[1] '\w' and '\s' are disjoint, so the result of the intersection is always going to be the empty set.
---


Test: no-useless-set-operand >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /[\w&&[\d\s]]/v
    |          ^~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /[[\d]]/v

[1] '\s' can be removed without changing the result of the subtraction.
---


Test: no-useless-set-operand >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /[\w&&[^\d\s]]/v
    |           ^~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /[\w&&[^\d]]/v

[1] '\s' can be removed without changing the result of the subtraction.
---


Test: no-useless-set-operand >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /[\w--\s]/v
    |   ^~~~~~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /[\w]/v

[1] '\w' and '\s' are disjoint, so the subtraction doesn't do anything.
---


Test: no-useless-set-operand >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /[\d--\w]/v
    |   ^~~~~~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /[]/v

[1] '\d' is a subset of '\w', so the result of the subtraction is always going to be the empty set.
---


Test: no-useless-set-operand >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /[^\d--\w]/v
    |    ^~~~~~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /[^]/v

[1] '\d' is a subset of '\w', so the result of the subtraction is always going to be the empty set.
---


Test: no-useless-set-operand >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /[\w--[\d\s]]/v
    |          ^~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /[\w--[\d]]/v

[1] '\s' can be removed without changing the result of the subtraction.
---


Test: no-useless-set-operand >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /[\w--[^\d\s]]/v
    |           ^~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /[\w--[^\d]]/v

[1] '\s' can be removed without changing the result of the subtraction.
---


Test: no-useless-set-operand >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /[\w--[a\q{aa|b}]]/v
    |            ^~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /[\w--[a\q{b}]]/v

[1] 'aa' can be removed without changing the result of the subtraction.
---


Test: no-useless-set-operand >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /[\w--[a\q{aa}]]/v
    |            ^~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /[\w--[a]]/v

[1] 'aa' can be removed without changing the result of the subtraction.

Test: no-useless-set-operand >> invalid
Code:
  1 | /[\w--\q{a|aa}]/v
    |            ^~ [1]

Output:
  1 | /[\w--\q{a}]/v

[1] 'aa' can be removed without changing the result of the subtraction.
